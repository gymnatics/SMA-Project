<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
	This theme park simulation project aims to maximize profit while maintaining high customer satisfaction. 
	The project will utilize agent-based modeling to simulate the behavior of individual visitors within the theme park
	 and their interactions with the attractions. The project will explore different combinations and configurations of attractions
	  to determine how they affect profit and visitor satisfaction. Metrics such as average queue length, average waiting time per customer, 
	  and average profits per customer will be computed to evaluate the performance of the theme park simulation.
	   Welch's method will be used to eliminate initialization bias and construct paired-t confidence intervals for differences 
	   in the performance of different theme park configurations.
</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>
	When this project was launched, we decided to do a theme-park-related simulation when we thought of Uncle Ringo. Uncle Ringo 
	has been a well-known and trusted name in Singapore since 1984, offering a wide range of carnival and family entertainment services. 
	With a long-standing history of organizing events such as carnivals, fun fairs, theme parties, product launches, fundraising charities, 
	and school events, Uncle Ringo is recognised as one of Singapore's leading providers of these services. Because of Uncle Ringo,
	 we thought it would be interesting to analyse the operations of a theme park and their implications on customer satisfaction.
